        <h3>About Able Table</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <p>There has been a recent trend in America to hone in on healthy eating patterns and reduce the growing obesity problem in our population.  It has been estimated that <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2013/01/02/the-heavy-price-of-losing-weight">Americans spend $60 billion annually on weight loss products and services</a>, as <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/100-million-dieters-20-billion-weight-loss-industry/story?id=16297197">108 million of us are on diets</a>. What truly has inspired the founding of Able Table, however, does not lie in trends but rather in personal values and upbringing, loss and observation, and the desire to help people to stop dieting, take control of their lives and find balance and enjoyment in eating good food and living a full life.  The food we put in our bodies has a huge impact on our health, our state of mind, and our well-being. The personal loss I experienced could have been avoided simply with good nutrition, healthy meals and a sustainable lifestyle.  I have always enjoyed cooking and baking for others. Additionally, I have received many requests over the years from friends and colleagues, to help them eat better food. With those pieces in mind, I founded Able&nbsp;Table.</p>

      	<h3>About Me</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    		<p>I grew up in the kitchen, cooking and experimenting with my Mexican grandmother, and learning my fractions in the columns of my mom's Betty Crocker cookbook.  I struck a deal at home that if I cooked dinner, I didn’t have to do the dishes – great motivation to learn to cook and to expand my repertoire! I had a little cake-baking business when I was 12, cooked meals for the local homeless shelter for the opportunity to cook for and feed others, and later made meals for my husband's single friends at their request. I referred to my side business cooking for these single men as “The Meal Plan” reminiscent of our college days in name only.  I love to entertain and have people over to test new recipes and share old favorites, to introduce traditions and to build and strengthen relationships over comforting and delicious&nbsp;meals.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    		<p>I recently completed the MBA program at Seattle University, specifically to give me the tools and courage to start the business I have been working towards since my cake-baking business as a kid. In addition to my love of cooking and baking, I am also an avid runner and passionate about health and fitness, and the connections they have with good food.  Now as a wife and mother of two young boys, healthy food has taken on even greater importance. I have been searching for a way to merge my passions and make a living doing what I enjoy - feeding people delicious and healthy food, giving them the opportunity to focus their energies on the things they love.  Able Table is the product of my education, passion, and desire to build a business helping others by doing what I&nbsp;love.</p>
